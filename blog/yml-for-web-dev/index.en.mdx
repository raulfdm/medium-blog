More and more, we, web developers need to learn about different areas to become better professionals and less dependent on others for simple things.

If you start a career as FE, you might see a lot of `.yml` files like `.travis.yml` (for Travis Build), `.gitlab-ci.yml` (for git lab CI), etc. but, let's be honest, what the hell?

Why would people use this kind of file? What's the benefit of it? How does this thing work?

So, the goal from this article is to introduce you to the `YAML` structure and give you more confidence to understand, read and change a file like this when you need it.

After all, we tend to feel very uncomfortable and frustrated and we need to do something and we can't even understand what's that.

## But first, What its YAML?

According to [the official website](https://yaml.org/), Yaml is:

<BigQuote>
  "YAML (a recursive acronym for "YAML Ain't Markup Language") is a human
  friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages."
</BigQuote>

Heavily used to write configuration files, which explains A LOT, right?

People were tired to have a bunch of configs nobody could understand until someone just say:

> What if we could somehow write our configuration like a "cake recipe"? I mean minimum bare text, very straight forward?

Boom, in May 2001 Yaml was created.

## YAML vs JSON

Surprisingly (or not really), Yaml is a superset of our well-known buddy JSON.

> "Superset is A programming language that contains all the features of a given language and has been expanded or enhanced to include other features as well." - [Font](https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/superset)

If I could give you a perspective of what it means I would say:

> In a FE world, Yaml would matches for TypeScript while JSON for JavaScript

To better understand how this would be even possible let's see this example:

```json:title=tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "system",
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "removeComments": true,
    "preserveConstEnums": true,
    "outFile": "../../built/local/tsc.js",
    "sourceMap": false,
    "types": ["node", "lodash", "express"]
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "**/*.spec.ts"]
}
```

This is a `tsconfig.json` example. very easy to read, we can easily identify what's what but... it has some limitations, like:

- Can't create variables;
- Can't use external variables (e.g. environment variables)
- Override values;

In JS world, if we can create a `.json` a configuration file, we almost always also can create a `.js` (like `.eslintrc` or `.eslint.js`) which allows us to mitigate the CONS mentioned before.

But then, if you're using other programing language, JS files isn't an option. And it's at this point Yaml starts to shine.

If we'd have to re-write the `tsconfig.json` in `YAML` syntax and having the exactly result, it'd be like:

```yaml:title=tsconfig.yml
compilerOptions:
  module: system
  noImplicitAny: true
  removeComments: true
  preserveConstEnums: true
  outFile: '../../built/local/tsc.js'
  sourceMap: false
  types:
    - node
    - lodash
    - express
include:
  - src/**/*
exclude:
  - node_modules
  - '**/*.spec.ts'
```

> Note this is only an example. You cannot write your `tsconfig` in YAML! 😜

I hope you're starting to get the idea from these files.

## Concepts, Types and Syntax

Now, let's dive deep a bit in the concept of the language.

### Indentation

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
In Yaml, indentation **do matter**. It uses _whitespace indentation_ to nest information. By whitespace, keep in mind `tab` is not allowed.

If you're like me and uses tab for everything, install some plugin in your IDE to replace your tabs for spaces (like [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/)). Doing that, when you hit a tab, it'll automatically replace your tab by space and you don't even need to use your space bar! ;)

### Root

Since indentation really matters here, if there's no space before the first declaration YAML will understand that's the root (level 0) of your file:

```yml
person:
  age: 20
```

Like we have in JSON with the first `{` curly brackets:

```json{1}
{
  "person": {
    "age": 20
  }
}
```

### Key/Value

Like in JSON/JS, `YAML` also uses the `key/value` syntax and you can use in various ways:

```yml
key: value
key_one: value one
key one: value # This works but it's weird
'my key': somekey
```

### Comments

To write a comment you just have to use `#` followed by your message.

```yml
# I'm a comment
person: # I'm also a comment
  age: 20
```

This is cool to document some decision or make a note. Unfortunately, we can't do this with JSON.

### Lists

There're 2 ways to write lists:

#### JSON way: array of strings

Remember Yaml is a JSON's superset? we can use its syntax:

```yml
people: ['Anne', 'John', 'Max']
```

#### Hyphen syntax

The most common (and probably recommended)

```yml
people:
  - Anne
  - John
  - Max
```

## Strings

There're a few ways to declare a string in Yaml:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yml
company: Google # Single words, no quotes
full_name: John Foo Bar Doe # Full sentence, no quotes
name: 'John' # Using single quotes
surname: "Christian Meyer" # Using double quotes
```

While in JSON we would have only a way to use double quotes:

```json
{
  "company": "Google",
  "full_name": "John Foo Bar Doe",
  "name": "John",
  "surname": "Christian Meyer"
}
```

As a suggestion, prefer to use quotes when you want to use **any** special character like `_`, `@`, etc.

### Numbers

Like in any programming language, we have 2 types of number: Integer and Float:

```yml
year: 2019 # Integer
nodeVersion: 10.8 # Float
```

### Node Anchors (variables-ish)

An anchor is a mechanism to create a group of data (an object) that can be injected or extended from other objects.

Let's imagine you need to create a configuration for your CI. It'll have both `production` and `staging` environment. As you can imagine, they share almost the same base settings.

In JSON world, we would have to duplicate these configs:

```json
{
  "production": {
    "node_version": "13.0.0",
    "os": "ubuntu",
    "package_manager": "yarn",
    "run": ["yarn install", "NODE_ENV=${ENVIRONMENT} yarn build"],
    "env": {
      "ENVIRONMENT": "production"
    }
  },
  "staging": {
    "node_version": "13.0.0",
    "os": "ubuntu",
    "package_manager": "yarn",
    "run": ["yarn install", "NODE_ENV=${ENVIRONMENT} yarn build"],
    "env": {
      "ENVIRONMENT": "staging"
    }
  }
}
```

Copy and paste are also annoying, especially when you have to change something in all places it's been used those Infos.

Anchors came to solve that problem. We can:

1. First, create our anchor

```yml{3}
# I name it as "base-config" but it can be whatever
# &base will be the "variable name" you'll use in the injection
base-config: &base
  node_version: 13.0.0
  os: ubuntu
  package_manager: yarn
  run:
    - yarn install
    - NODE_ENV=${ENVIRONMENT} yarn build
```

2. Then, injecting the anchor created in the level we want to have to see these values being injected:

```yml{11,17}
base-config: &base
  node_version: 13.0.0
  os: ubuntu
  package_manager: yarn
  run:
    - yarn install
    - NODE_ENV=${ENVIRONMENT} yarn build

production:
  # I'm injecting all "base" attributes and values inside production
  <<: *base
  env:
    - ENVIRONMENT: production

staging:
  # I'm injecting all "base" attributes and values inside staging
  <<: *base
  env:
    - ENVIRONMENT: staging
```

Looks simpler, right? And also easier to maintain.

If you copy this code and paste into a "Yaml to JSON converter" online tool you'll see the same code as I mentioned early in the JSON example but within the addition of the base config:

```json{8-29}
{
  "base-config": {
    "node_version": "13.0.0",
    "os": "ubuntu",
    "package_manager": "yarn",
    "run": ["yarn install", "NODE_ENV=${ENVIRONMENT} yarn build"]
  },
  "production": {
    "node_version": "13.0.0",
    "os": "ubuntu",
    "package_manager": "yarn",
    "run": ["yarn install", "NODE_ENV=${ENVIRONMENT} yarn build"],
    "env": [
      {
        "ENVIRONMENT": "production"
      }
    ]
  },
  "staging": {
    "node_version": "13.0.0",
    "os": "ubuntu",
    "package_manager": "yarn",
    "run": ["yarn install", "NODE_ENV=${ENVIRONMENT} yarn build"],
    "env": [
      {
        "ENVIRONMENT": "staging"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### JSON syntax (yes, JSON)

As explained before a superset of a language is the base language PLUS some extra features, which means we could write a `Yaml` file in JSON way

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yml
{
  "details": {
    "company": {
      "name": "Google",
      "year": 2019,
      "active": true
    },
    "employees": [
      "Anne",
      "John",
      "Max"
    ]
  }
}
```

> Doubting? Copy this code and paste [it here](https://onlineyamltools.com/convert-yaml-to-json)

If you convert this YAML to JSON, you'll have the same structure:

```json
{
  "details": {
    "company": {
      "name": "Google",
      "year": 2019,
      "active": true
    },
    "employees": ["Anne", "John", "Max"]
  }
}
```

### Shell/Bash environment

As I told at the beginning of this article, it's very common `.yml` files are used as config files for many things, but especially for CI/CD environment.

For those, you'll have to describe how the machine/docker should work, what should be installed, ran, etc.

Commonly, all those environments are Linux, which means you'll also have access to the environment itself.

On GitLab CI, for instance, you can specify on a global level environment variables you want to have available for the whole process:

```yml{1-2,8}
variables:
  NODE_IMAGE: node:10

stages:
  - build

test:
  image: $NODE_IMAGE
  stage: build
```

Note that the syntax to use variables by `$` isn't from YAML but `shell/bash`.

What GitLab CI does is getting everything you'd defined in `variables` and creates `shell` variables.

Some other platforms also inject other values like commit ref, branch name, build time, author and also secret keys defined outside the configuration:

```yml{11}
variables:
  NODE_IMAGE: node:10

stages:
  - build

test:
  image: $NODE_IMAGE
  stage: build
  artifacts:
    name: $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME
```

In the example above, we're using a `$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME` external environment variable that GitLab CI platform makes available which describes `The branch or tag name for which project is built`.

---

## Conclusion

I hope you now understand a bit more about YAML and at least feel comfortable reading and write your files.

Keep in mind that what you'll have access to or not, the limitations will be determined by the platform you're using. Travis defines a different configuration than GitLab CI or CircleCI for example.

Always check the documentation from the platform you're working on to see what's possible or not to be done! :)
