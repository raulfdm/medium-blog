For hosting I use Netlify services. Since they have limit amount of machine usage, I build using Github Actions and only ship the files via Netlici CLI.

## Language

This blog is mainly in Brazilian Portuguese (my mother language) just because when I started to write I didn't know english and I was engaged to the brazilian dev community.

However the interface is translated and there are blog posts in both English and Portuguese language.

## Blog post structure

For new blog posts, a folder with the following structure should be created inside `blog` folder:

```txt
blog/<post-short-title>/index.mdx
```

For an English translation, in the post folder, just add a file `index.en.mdx`
