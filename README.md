## Language

The default language is my mother lang, PT-BR ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· but I already prepare the environment for English posts as soon I have them.

## Stack

- TypeScript
- [Gatsby started default](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default);
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/);
- [Styled Icons](styled-icons.js.org/);
- [React Inlt](https://github.com/formatjs/react-intl) for locales

## How to run

1. Clone this repository
1. Install all dependencies by running `yarn`
1. Run the dev server by running `yarn dev`

## Structure

For new blog posts, a folder with the following structure should be created inside `blog` folder:

```txt
blog/<post-year>/<post-month>/<post-short-title>/index.md
```

For an English translation, in the post folder, just add a file `index.en.md`
