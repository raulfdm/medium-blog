Although it was working perfectly, the website I used has a very limited amount of subtitles available.\n\nIn the second version of the CLI, I took a step further and refactor the whole CLI to use [opensubtitles.org](https://www.opensubtitles.org) API, which has a so much bigger database but also subtitles for movies and documentaries. Also, since they have a very limited and restricted API, I also needed to create a server to be a proxy for all requests made by the CLI uses.\n\nYou can check the source code and the ideas in https://github.com/sub-tv",
